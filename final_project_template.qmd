## Overview {#sec-overview}

Studying both biological and virtual twins can provide comprehensive insights into the influences of genetics and environment. Biological twins help emphasize the impact of genetic factors, whereas virtual twins highlight the role of shared early-life environmental factors. The main objective of this twin study is to distinguish the contribution of nature in influencing height and weight, as opposed to nurture."

## Introduction {#sec-introduction}

There is no doubt that genetic and environmental factors significantly impact early childhood growth and development. Complex interactions and correlations exist among genetic, prenatal environmental, and postnatal environmental influences, leading to a range of health-related outcomes. However, much debate has concerned the dominant influence of nature or nurture. Twin and adoption studies have been widely employed by researchers to assess differences within study pairs and estimate the contributions of genetic and environmental factors to various traits and behaviors. In this study, we aim to evaluate whether genetics or the shared environment significantly influences the variations in height and weight among pairs of twins, siblings, and adoptees.

When we dive into the study of height and weight in twins and adoptees, genes certainly lay the groundwork, but where and how a child is raised also play a crucial role of their early growth and development. This complex question requires insights from various fields. 
In the scientific area, geneticists start searching for the specific genes that affect height and weight the most. Meanwhile, nutrition experts bring in their expertise to exploring how their diets shape these physical characteristics. Epidemiologists shift their concerns to figure out how common certain height and weight traits are and what factors are more likely to contribute to these differences, while biostatisticians step into analyzing datasets and quantifying the relative contributions of genetics and environment to variations in individual characteristics.
These fields will share their own piece to the puzzle to understanding the interfaces of nature and nurture in childrenâ€™s early years of growth and development.

## Methods {#sec-methods}

Describe the data used and general methodological approach used to address the problem described in the @sec-introduction. Subsequently, incorporate full R code necessary to retrieve and clean data, and perform analysis. Be sure to include a description of code so that others (including your future self) can understand what you are doing and why.

## Results {#sec-results}

Describe your results and include relevant tables, plots, and code/comments used to obtain them. You may refer to the @sec-methods as needed. End with a brief conclusion of your findings related to the question you set out to address. You can include references if you'd like, but this is not required.

## Conclusion

This the conclusion. The @sec-results can be invoked if you'd like.
